## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
## Load the data
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv",sep=",")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
totalsteps<-lapply(split(activity$steps,activity$date),function(x) sum(x,na.rm=TRUE))
totalsteps<-unlist(totalsteps)
## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(totalsteps,main="total number of steps taken each day")
## Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
summary(totalsteps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
averagesteps<-lapply(split(activity$steps,activity$interval),function(x) mean(x,na.rm=TRUE))
averagesteps<-unlist(averagesteps)
## Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
plot(unique(activity$interval),averagesteps,type="l",xlab="5-minute interval",ylab="average number of steps across all days")
summary(averagesteps)
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
